# Financial and Dynamic Econometrics

This repository contains a collection of projects developed by our group as part of the **Financial and Dynamic Econometrics** courses at AGH University of Krak√≥w. These projects showcase a variety of methodologies and analyses, focusing on the intersection of finance and econometrics, with particular emphasis on dynamic models and their applications in real-world financial contexts, particularly emphasizing dynamic models and the empirical analysis of financial time series.

## Course Overview
The Financial and Dynamic Econometrics course provides a deep dive into econometric methods tailored for analyzing financial data, with a focus on dynamic and complex models. Through this course, students develop proficiency in assessing financial time series and applying models to real-world financial data, building expertise in the following areas:

Key Topics Covered

- Empirical Properties of Financial Time Series
Exploration of financial data characteristics, including trends, volatility clustering, and non-stationarity in time series.

- Volatility Modeling
Understanding price volatility in financial instruments and implementing models to capture this volatility effectively.

- GARCH and Stochastic Volatility Models
Introduction to models such as GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity), stochastic volatility models, and realized volatility to analyze varying degrees of financial market risk.

- Long Memory and Persistence
Examination of long-term dependencies and persistence in financial time series, which are critical for modeling and forecasting.

- Conditional Dependency Dynamics
Advanced models for conditional dependencies, such as CCC-GARCH (Constant Conditional Correlation GARCH), BEKK (Baba, Engle, Kraft, and Kroner), and GO-GARCH (Generalized Orthogonal GARCH), to understand correlations and risk contagion across financial markets.

- Financial Market Contagion
Study of contagion effects where market stress propagates across different financial assets or markets, especially during crises.

- Value at Risk (VaR)
Estimation of risk measures, including Value at Risk for individual assets and portfolios, to quantify potential losses in adverse market conditions.
